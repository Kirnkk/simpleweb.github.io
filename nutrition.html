    <h1>Gym Diet</h1>
    <p>There are mainly three macronutrients that play a crucial role in maintaining bodily functions and even promote changes in strength and composition – they are carbs, proteins, and fats  in your gym diet plan for muscle gain and weight loss.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong></li>
        <p>Firstly, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body and therefore play the most substantial role in fueling exercise. There are two different types of carbohydrates i.e. complex and simple. .</p>
        <li><strong>Proteins</strong></li>
        <p> A gym diet plan must include protein. During exercise, the body is exposed to strains and stresses. Protein is found most highly in animal produce such as lean meats, eggs & dairy, seeds, nuts, legumes, beans, and soy.</p>
        <li><strong>Fats</strong></li>
        <p> Fats play a key role in the absorption and transport of nutrients,they can have  a positive impact on heart health and hormone production.Examples of unsaturated fat foods include avocados, seeds, nuts, peanut butter, fish, oils, and soy.</p>
    </ol>
